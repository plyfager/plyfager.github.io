I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student at SMU under the guidance of Professor [He Shengfeng](http://www.shengfenghe.com/). Prior to this, I had the privilege of working for two years at the [Shanghai AI Lab](https://www.shlab.org.cn/)'s [OpenMMLab](https://openmmlab.com/) team, where I played a major role in the development of [MMGeneration](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmgeneration) and [MMagic](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmagic).
